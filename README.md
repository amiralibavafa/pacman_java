# Pac-Man Game in Java 🎮

This is a simple Pac-Man game built in Java using Java Swing and utility classes to demonstrate basic game development skills. The game features a simple implementation of the classic Pac-Man game where the player navigates Pac-Man through a maze, collecting dots and avoiding ghosts. 👻

## Features ✨

- **Classic Pac-Man Gameplay**: The player controls Pac-Man, who must collect all the dots in the maze while avoiding ghosts. 🍒
- **Ghost AI with Greedy Search**: Ghosts use a greedy search algorithm to chase Pac-Man, prioritizing the shortest path towards Pac-Man's current location. 🧠👹
- **Simple GUI**: The game uses Java Swing to create a graphical user interface to display the maze, Pac-Man, and ghosts. 🖥️
- **Score Tracking**: The player's score is displayed, which increases as Pac-Man collects dots. 📊

## Prerequisites 📋

Make sure you have the following installed:
- **Java 8 or higher**: Java Development Kit (JDK) to compile and run the game. ☕️
